# Learning Project React + TypeScript

This is a learning project where I am exploring React and TypeScript by building a simple e-commerce frontend. The project simulates a basic online store where users can browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and manage their orders. An example implementation of the static build can be found [here](https://dev.felix-palm.ch/react/shop-frontend/).

## Project Overview

This project aims to help me get hands-on experience with React and TypeScript:

- React: Building UI components and managing state.
- TypeScript: Using types to catch errors early and ensure code quality.
- State Management: Handling state with React's hooks.
- Component Design: Structuring the application into reusable and maintainable components.
- Props and State: Passing data between components and handling local state.

## Future Improvements

- Routing: Add routing to navigate between different product pages
- Styling: Improve the UI with CSS/SCSS and use a UI library like Material-UI.
- Testing: Write unit tests for components using a testing framework like Jest.
